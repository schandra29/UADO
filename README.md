# UADO
Universal AI Development Orchestrator (UADO) A CLI-based orchestration layer that synchronizes AI coding agents (GPT, Claude, Gemini) with real-time compiler and linter readiness. Prevents recursive fix loops and phantom errors by intelligently gating prompt timing using file watchers, diagnostic signals, and cooldown prediction.
